# Noise Map Manipulator

Whether you aim to create natural looking terrain, add details to pale texture or embed dynamic sky in you game, you hardly ever do it by hand. So called noise maps (for instance Perlin Noice) with proper usage can generate well suited elements. For this reason I decided to challange myself and create this library equipped with functionality required to generate noise maps and manipulate to achieve various effects. 

## Examples

API delievered by this library is capable of creating such images:
(All of those images can be generated with code included in ```main.c```)
